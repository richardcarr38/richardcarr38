<h2><p>Football is very near and dear to my heart I have been playing the sport since i was 6 years old, that’s 13 years! 
	Growing up I never would have thought that football would have taught me so many life lessons and most of all how 
	to be a man. Playing little league was a breeze for me, I was star. Making the transition from little league to high
	school was a little rough for me because it was the first time coaches didn't baby me. They were hard on me only to 
	make me but a young me didn't realize that at the time. As time went on I began to realize what the coaches were trying
	to do. They were doing more than just coaching me through the sport of football, they were coaching me through life. 
	Then that is when I realized football was more than just a game. Football in highschool for me was amazing. Me and my 
	senior class went out the way we wanted too. We finished with an undefeated season and we were number 1 in the state 
	number 1 in the region and number 8 in the country and we won the Pennsylvania state championship. The transition from 
	high school to college was easy for me because my high school team was ran like a college. Only thing that is different
	is now I’m working out hard every day and the competition is at an all time high. There’s no more of just a couple of 
	people being good. I’m on a team where everyone was one of the top players in their area when they were in high school. 
	So college is great and the competition is great and it is allowing me to reach my best.</p></h2>
